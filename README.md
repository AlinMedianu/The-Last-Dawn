# The-Last-Dawn
A university group project meant to show the effective use of DirectX 11 into creating an endless race against the sun.
My main contribution was the graphical effects part of this project.I have used sprite scrolling and additive blending to 
make a scrolling parallax background. I have used texture sampling on a noise map and pixel clipping to achieve a dissolve 
effect. I have used multi-pass rendering to create an outline effect. I have also used the tessellation stage of the graphics
pipeline, along side with control point back face culling, noise based vertex displacement and emmisive lighting to achieve
a complex Sun shader.
My other contributions were an efficient generic spawner and utility classes like a Timer and a Random class.
